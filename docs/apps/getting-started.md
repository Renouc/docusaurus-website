# Getting Started with Apps

Welcome to the Shoplazza App Development Guide! This documentation will help you quickly get started with building apps.

## What is an App?

An app is a custom tool that extends Shoplazza's functionality and can be integrated into various locations such as the admin panel, online store, checkout page, and more.

## Quick Start

### 1. Register a Developer Account

First, you need to register an account on the Shoplazza Developer Platform.

### 2. Create an App

After logging in, click "Create New App" and fill in the basic information:

- App name
- App description
- App icon

### 3. Get API Keys

Each app will receive a unique API key for communicating with the Shoplazza API.

## Next Steps

See the [App Development Guide](/docs/apps/development-guide) for more details.
