# App Development Guide

This is a comprehensive app development guide that will walk you through the entire development process.

## Development Environment Setup

First, ensure you have set up your development environment:

```bash
# Install Node.js and npm
node --version
npm --version

# Create project directory
mkdir my-app
cd my-app
```

## API Integration

Apps need to interact with the Shoplazza API to fetch and manipulate data.

### Authentication

All API requests require authentication using your API key:

```javascript
const headers = {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${YOUR_API_KEY}`,
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
};
```

### Making Requests

```javascript
fetch('https://api.shoplazza.com/v1/resource', {
  method: 'GET',
  headers: headers
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log(data));
```

## Building the Frontend

When building your app's frontend interface, it's recommended to use modern frameworks like React or Vue.

## Testing and Debugging
